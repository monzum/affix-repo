<Purpose>
  Advertises the server's string representation of its affix stack. When a client
  is about to connect to this server, the coordination affix looks up the string
  representation and constructs the same affixs. At this point, both the server
  and the client have the same affixs. As their affix stacks are balanced, the
  connection is established and ready to be returned to the application.

  The advertisement key for a server is "host,port,protocol", where host is the
  hostname of the server and protocol can be either UDP or TCP. The
  advertisement value is the string representation of the CoordinationAffix's
  affix stack.

  If a zenodotus name is provided to listenforconn, this affix will also
  advertise the mapping of the name to the current IP address of the host. Any
  change in the IP address will cause the mapping to be updated, but unless used
  along with the mobility affix, the listener will not be able to accept new
  connections because it is bound to the old IP address.

  The coordination affix should always sit on top of an application's affix stack,
  so that it can see the content of the rest of the stack.
