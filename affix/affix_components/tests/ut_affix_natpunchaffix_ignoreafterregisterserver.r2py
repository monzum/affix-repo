"""
Connect to myself using a NAT forwarder also hosted by this script. 
Check that the NatPunchAffix in use (rather than the client or server 
thread) detects when the server stops replying to CHECK_APPEND_CONN_REQUESTs 
that are sent when the server calls the NatPunchAffix'ed getconnection().

This is implemented by making the NAT forwarder sit and not call recv() 
on the control connection socket after the server has registered.

XXX Ideally, the control connection would time out after a while, but the 
XXX current NatPunchAffix doesn't include that functionality.

Note: Including the NAT forwarder code (rather than importing it 
and overriding parts) is a really ugly hack. This needs to be done 
better!

# as one client blocks all of the others for a second, then the 
# next blocks the other ones, etc.).
# A meaningful minimum even in the multiple-clients case is probably
